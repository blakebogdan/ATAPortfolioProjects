# COVID-Data-Exploration-SQL
This project takes a look at COVID infection and vaccination data and pulls various insights from the data using SQL . In this project, an initial analysis, cleaning, and filtering of the data was done with SQL to gain an understanding of the data and generate insights and statistics not initially found within.

See below for a walkthrough of each of the files included in this repository:

1. "CovidDeaths.xlsx" - Data around the COVID infection and death totals broken out by country and day. This was one of two tables that formed the dataset being queried.
2. "CovidVaccinations.xlsx" - Data around the number of vaccinations administered broken out by country and day. This was two of two tables that formed the dataset being queried.
3. "COVID Portfolio Project - SQL Snippets" - Actual pieces of SQL used to explore the data, make joins, and create new fields using the base data.
